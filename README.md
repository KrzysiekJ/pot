# POT

## Introduction

POT is an Erlang library for generating one time passwords. It supports both HMAC-based one time passwords (HOTP) and time based ones (TOTP). The generated passwords are compatible with [Google Authenticator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator).

POT is an almost direct translation of the Python [OneTimePass](https://github.com/tadeck/onetimepass) library.

POT should work with any recent version of [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org/), [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and other Erlang VM based languages.

In order to learn more about one time password generation, see the following Wikipedia articles:

- [Google Authenticator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator)
- [HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)
- [Time-based One-time Password Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)

## Usage (Erlang)

We recommend using [rebar3](https://github.com/erlang/rebar3) for managing dependencies and building the library. POT is available on hex.pm, so you can just include the following in your `rebar.config`:

```
{deps, [pot]}.
```

POT works with binary tokens and secrets.

### Create a time based token

```erlang
Secret = <<"MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK">>,
Token = pot:totp(Secret),
% Do something with the token
```

### Create an HMAC based token

```erlang
Secret = <<"MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK">>,
CurrentTrial = 3,
Token = pot:hotp(Secret, CurrentTrial),
% Do something with the token
```

### Check some time based token

```erlang
Secret = <<"MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK">>,
Token = <<"123456">>,
IsValid = pot:valid_totp(Token, Secret),
% Do something
```

### Check some HMAC based token

```erlang
Secret = <<"MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK">>,
Token = <<"123456">>,
LastUsed = 5,  % last successful trial
IsValid = pot:valid_hotp(Token, Secret, [{last, LastUsed}]),
% Do something
```

### Create a time based token with 30 seconds ahead

```erlang
Secret = <<"MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK">>,
Token = pot:totp(Secret, [{addWindow, 1}]),
% Do something
```

### Check some time based token on Android devices with 15 seconds ahead

```erlang
Secret = <<"MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK">>,
Token = <<"123456">>,
IsValid = pot:valid_totp(Token, Secret, [{window, 1}, {addWindow, 1}]),
% Do something
```

### Create a time based token for given time

Time format is `{MegaSecs, Secs, MicroSecs}` received by os:timestamp()

```erlang
Secret = <<"MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK">>,
Token = pot:totp(Secret, [{timestamp, {1518, 179058, 919315}}]),
% Token will be <<"151469">>
```


## Usage (Elixir)

Include POT in your `mix.exs` as a dependency:

```elixir
defp deps do
    [{:pot, "~>0.9.6"}]
end
```

### Create a time based token

```elixir
secret = "MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK"
token = :pot.totp(secret)
# Do something with the token
```

### Create an HMAC based token

```elixir
secret = "MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK"
current_trial = 3
token = :pot.hotp(secret, current_trial)
# Do something with the token
```

### Check some time based token

```elixir
secret = "MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK"
token = "123456"
is_valid = :pot.valid_totp(token, secret)
# Do something
```

### Check some HMAC based token

```elixir
secret = "MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK"
token = "123456"
last_used = 5  # last successful trial
is_valid = :pot.valid_hotp(token, secret, [{:last, last_used}])
# Do something
```

### Create a time based token with 30 seconds ahead

```elixir
secret = "MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK"
token = :pot.totp(secret, [addwindow: 1])
# Do something
```

### Check some time based token on Android devices with 15 seconds ahead

```elixir
secret = "MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK"
token = "123456"
is_valid = :pot.valid_totp(token, secret, [window: 1, addwindow: 1])
# Do something
```

### Create a time based token for given time

Time format is `{MegaSecs, Secs, MicroSecs}` received by :os.timestamp()

```elixir
secret = "MFRGGZDFMZTWQ2LK"
token = :pot.totp(secret, [timestamp: {1518, 179058, 919315}])
# Token will be <<"151469">>
```
